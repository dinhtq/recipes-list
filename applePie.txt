For the crust:

2½ cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes
¼ to ½ cup ice water

For the filling:

6 to 7 medium apples (Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a mix), peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
¾ cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)
Optional: Extra sugar for sprinkling

Prepare the crust:

Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar.
Cut in Butter: Add the chilled butter to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with pea-sized pieces.
Add Water: Gradually sprinkle ice water over the mixture, stirring gently until the dough just comes together. Do not overmix.
Chill Dough: Divide the dough into two equal disks, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
